# Call-Centre-Performance-Report
This is an individual project using PowerBi where I have created an interactive dashboard to track and analyse the performance of different agents in a Call Centre.
In this project I have:
  - Used various parameters to drill down into the worksheet and customize it using filters and slicers.
  - Used different types of customized visualizations like bar charts, pie charts and cards.
  - Performed calculations to manipulate data

Using the aforementioned parameters I was able to analyse the following KPIs:
  - Overall customer satisfaction
  - Overall calls answered/abandoned
  - Calls by time
  - Average speed of answer
  - Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

*Call Centre Dataset.xlsx* contains the dataset for this project. **Here is a screenshot of how the dataset looks like.**
